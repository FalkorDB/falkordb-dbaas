Defines a GKE cluster that will centralize observability on all customer deployments.

The control plane for the observability stack is composed of the following components:

   - FluxCD: Sync all observability components in all clusters
   - Thanos: Store and query Prometheus metrics across all clusters
     - Internal Load Balancer: Expose Thanos to the application plane
   - Grafana: Visualize metrics from Thanos
     - External Load Balancer: Expose Grafana to the internet
 - GCS Bucket: Store metrics from Thanos
 - VPC Peering connection to each application network: allow streaming metrics from the application plane to the control plane
